# Overview

1. Relationship between functions

    > distance and speed
    
    > height and slope

2. Slope of the great functions of Calculus

    > y = x squared
    
    > y = sin x
    
    > y = e to the x

3. Example 1: what does slope mean?
    
    > y = x squared

4. Example 2: what does slope mean?
    
    > y = sin x

    > dy/dx = cos x
